# Bond speed rom

This romhack is designed to show Bond's actual speed as displacement per update/frame.

# Version

The NTSC xdelta patch should be applied against US NTSC .z64 with SHA1 `ABE01E4AEB033B6C0836819F549C791B26CFDE83`.

# User Interface

The HUD looks like:

![hud](hud.png)

From left to right:

- `T`: mission timer
- `spd`: Amount Bond has moved since last update
- `lag`: Number of frames since last update.

When Bond collides with anything, the HUD changes to a slight red background
